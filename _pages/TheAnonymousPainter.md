One nice day (07/2006), I was working on my own in a Starbucks coffee at the corner of National & Barrington in Los Angeles. 
I guess I was pretty focused since, out of the blue, a young woman stopped by my table, said, “thank you for being such a nice model!” 
gave me a piece of paper and left. By the time I looked around to see what was going on, she had already left the store; 
I don’t even remember her face. Apparently, (as I was told by someone who sat at a nearby table), she was sitting there for quite
a while taking my picture, and I didn’t notice... too much work, I guess. Interestingly, on the back of the paper (first drawing below),
there are a few different figures; I’m one of them (can you guess which?). Then she turned the page and focused solely on me.... 
(this is the second drawing below)
